         Majority invests in technology startups that 
         * improve the earnings of people living on under Rs. 500 ($6) a day.
         * build scalable solutions to tough problems. i.e. Startups which can reasonably target 50+ million customers within a few years.
         * India-first solutions but can also scale to similar geographies like South East Asia and Africa in a few years.
         * Have a profit orientation, and an eye on unit economics.

         We have scaled tech businesses to millions of customers, held P & L responsibilities, and delivered impact to millions. Hence we are able to strike a balance between the two heads of impact and results.
